# Open XAL ESS lattices

This repository provides with Open XAL SMF lattice definition files for the ESS Linac.

There are two set of lattice  files at this moment:
* current: represent the current status of the machine, including only the elements installed in the tunnel and with the configuration used for commissioning.
* design: the full accelerator according to the official TraceWin lattice repository (https://gitlab.esss.lu.se/ess-bp/ess-lattice).
